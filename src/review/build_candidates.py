"""
Build the list of (paper, dataset) pairs a person still has to check.

Every pair the classifier called REUSE goes in, with everything a reviewer
needs to judge it: the paper, the dataset, the paper it cited where there is
one, the model's reasoning and the passages it quoted. Reviewing reads only
this file, so the classification outputs and the discovery corpora are consulted
once here rather than at the start of every session.

The fields the classifier answered alongside REUSE come along too. They are not
shown during review, which asks one question; they are what assign_reviews
filters a round on.

Writes reviews/reuse_candidates.json, sorted by pair, so rerunning the pipeline
shows up as the pairs it added rather than as an unreadable rewrite.

Usage:
    python -m src.review.build_candidates \
        -i output/fulltext_classifications.json \
        -i output/fulltext_direct_openalex.json
